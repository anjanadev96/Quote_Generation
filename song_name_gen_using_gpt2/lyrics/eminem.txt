damage<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>‘Cause they hurt you so bad<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's like they murdered your ass<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And threw dirt on your casket<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But you've returned from the ashes<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And while you're burning the past<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Standing at inferno and chant—<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'm standin' in the flames<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It’s a beautiful kind of

light<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You're so familiarized<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>With what having to swallow this pill is like<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And it's as though you feel you've died<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>‘Cause you've been killed inside<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But yet you're still alive<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Which means you will survive<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Although today you may weep ‘cause you're weak and<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Everything seems so bleak and<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Hopeless, the light that you're seekin'<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It begins to seep in, that's the only thing keepin'<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You from leapin' off the mothafreakin' deep end<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And with a little time that should do the healing<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And by tomorrow, you may even feel so good that you're willing<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>To forgive 'em, even after all the shit you been put through<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>This feeling of resilience is building<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And the flames are burnin' quick as fire would through this building<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You're sealed in, but you're fireproof<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Flame retardant, you withstood it<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin'<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You look down, ‘cause you're so over 'em you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>As time passes, things

flames<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Throw the match, set the past ablaze<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So feel the fire beneath your feet<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>As you barely even perspire from the heat<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And as you say goodbye to the grief<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But you've extinguished this livin' hell<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Still, a little piece of you dies as you scream—<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'm standin'

you ain't my girlfriend<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>All I know is that <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>When I'm with you, I'm a different person, yeah<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I ain't never met a chick as perfect<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Girl, you're a ten, so here I am <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Laying here with her again<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Thinking 'bout you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>She's asleep, you're texting me around two<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Crying face emoji, you say, This is me without you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>We're sneaking out to meet at cheap hotel rooms or<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Sex in the car, then I'll text you tomorrow<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Do I question it? Nah, no objection at all<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause both of us are still involved, so<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>As I'm peelin' off, all I'm thinking 'bout is<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'm not happy here , with her<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Rather have you , rather have me too<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause you're not happy there , with him<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Rather have me , we’re just in too deep<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You're laying there with him, thinking 'bout me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>He's asleep, you say, Let's meet around three<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You went to leave the house, he caught you sneaking out, now he's freaking out<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You thought he was sleepin' soundly, woah<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You say you're going for a drive, you don't question him<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>When he stumbles in, like, Where the fuck you've been?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Then you pump his ear with what he wants to hear<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Tell him you love him, yeah, wipe each other's tears<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But it's been a couple years since we been doin' dirt<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You or my girl, don't wanna see either of you get hurt<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But now the lines are getting super blurred<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Can't tell if I'm cheating on her with you or cheating on you with her<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But really, nobody's at fault, can't help who you love<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Hope they don't overhear us talk<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause we both are getting sloppy<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Probably subconsciously part of me's hoping we get caught 'cause<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'm not happy here , with her<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Rather have you , rather have me too<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause you're not happy there , with him<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Rather have me , we’re just in too deep<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>We're laying here with them, thinking 'bout us<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause now when we get home, we get jealous<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Of each other being someone else's<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Call us Long John Silver's 'cause we selfish<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I just wanna see ya<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Don't care if it's at the Ritz or Motel 6<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>If I'm there with ya, rich or poor<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>When I'm laying here with ya, it could be the kitchen floor<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I could stay in bed with ya starin' at ya 'til the morn'<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I just wanna be your secret lover, yeah<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'd rather share ya than to not have you at all<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So once a year or twice a month I'm here if you want it<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Yeah, I'm open season<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I'm always game, so I keep it a hundred, dear, haha<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause we could never be each other's everythings, you got a wedding ring<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So it's him instead of me, but I'll be your second string, now and forever because<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'm not happy here , with her<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Rather have you , rather have me too<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause you're not happy there , with him<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Rather have me , we’re just in too deep Before I check the mic <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I give it a extra swipe with a Lysol disinfectant wipe <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Coronavirus in effect tonight<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Antiseptics on deck, I got every type <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I throw on my tux, then I  give zero fucks, then I <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Act like a jockstrap , cup my nuts, then I <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Check my ball hair , make sure it's all there <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Then call the pallbearer <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's Music to Bе Murdered By again, why stop?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Overkill likе a pipe bomb in your pine box<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You're all hitched to my cock <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Went from punchin' a time clock to getting my shot<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Then treated it like a cyclops<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Like it's the only one I  got<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And my thoughts are like nines cocked <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Every line's obscene, pervertedest mind, got the dirtiest rhyme stocked<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>That's why there's parental advising  every time I drop <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So throw on the theme to Alfred, I'll channel him like the Panama Canal<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But how could I get up in arms about you saying trash is all that I put out?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Bitch, I still get the bag when I'm putting garbage out<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Plus, the potty mouth, I'm not about to wash it out<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The filthiest, so all this talk about I'm washed up, how preposterous<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Because if cleanliness is next to godliness<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's obvious that it's impossible for me to be beside myself<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I'm 'bout that capital like a proper noun<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Still on top the pile<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Got me sitting on numbers like a pocket dial<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Quick to call you out on your bullshit<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Don't make me give that crock a dial<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause if I do it, see you later, alligator<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Made it out the trailer, then I made a vow to cater to no one<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So hate, I've gained about the same amount that's in my bank account<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So here's some more shit for you to complain about, I say the<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Bars that never slack , but always get attacked <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I think they're gunnin' for me, it's startin' to feel like that<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Like I'm marked, 'cause when I rap, it's like fallin' on my back in a tar pit<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause I have this target on my back <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But if I ever double-crossed my fans and lost my Stans<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'd probably pop five Xans <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Go in my garage, start my van<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Inhale as much carbon monoxide and exhaust I can<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And doze off like snores<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But odds like that, with these thoughts I have's like a giant getting squashed by ants<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>If this is the test of time, I'd pass with flying colors<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Like I just tossed my crayons <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Small, medium, and large size cans<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Sanitizers of all types, brands, cost nine bands<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Which is a small price for Lysol wipes and<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>If my palms brush across my pants, I wash my hands<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Shit, hold on, man<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Motherfucker<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Happy birthday to—<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Fuck <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I sit in silence in candlelit environments<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Sipping Wild Irish while getting violent<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Homicidal visions when I'm spitting like this<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But really I'm just fulfilling my wish of killing rhymes<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Which is really childish and silly, but I'm really like this<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'm giving nightmares to Billie Eilish, I'm Diddy's side bitch<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>What the fuck? Hold on, wait<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'm Diddy's side bitch?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Oh, I'm still east side, bitch<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So 'til the E-N-D, since EPMD<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Been givin' y'all the business , D-R-E and me <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>From the MMLP to  MTBMB <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Bitch, it's 2020, you still ain't seein' me <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So call me Santa Claus <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause at the present , I out-rap 'em all , I'm at the mall<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Got your bitch in a bathroom stall, she could suck a basketball <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Through a plastic straw  with a fractured jaw <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>My dick is coat check , she wanna jack it off <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'm so far past the bar, I should practice law<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Mentally, I'm fucked up generally  <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Dukes of Hazzard car , get the cadaver dogs<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause this is murder, murder and you'll get murked, murked<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>This music 'bout to kill you, brr, brr <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>This chicken hit my phone, she said, Chirp, chirp<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I said, Hut, hut, hike your skirt, skirt<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Then go eat some worms, like the early bird<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>What the fuck is love? That's a dirty word<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Make me fall in it, there's not a girl on Earth<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Or any other planet, that's a world of hurt<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I won't buy a designer, 'cause I don't pander <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I'm back with so many knots, I need a chiropractor <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And this the final chapter , 'cause I'm either frying after <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Or they gon' give me the needle  like a vinyl scratcher <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Yeah, I'm a card, like Hallmark<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>At Walmart with a small cart buying wall art<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And y'all who claim to be dogs aren't<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>No bite, like a tree, mostly just all bark, arf, arf<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But y'all pickin' the wrong tree, they call me dog because I'm barking <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I got a lot, yeah, like where cars park<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'd describe it as bowling  ball hard <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause the gutter's where my mind is and when<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's in this frame, better split like the five and the ten<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause without a second to spare, I'm strikin' again<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And when the beat is up my alley, I go right for the pens <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The cypher begins<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'm talkin' smack like heroin, the mic's a syringe<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's like a binge, Vicodin, I would liken to tin<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>My mind is a recycling bin<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>There's no place I never been<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I never budge and I never bend<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You hyperextend on me, this game's life, it depends<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Like adult diapers for men<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Even when I'm rappin' less stellar<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's sour grapes, I still whine, I'm the best seller <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Like a trey deuce, spray you as these shots penetrate through Dre's booth<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And go straight through your grapefruit, no escape route<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So you won't leave here just scathed with a few scrape wounds<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Your ass is grass and I am not gonna graze you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But if bars were semi-mac's, I'd be the Mad Hatter<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause I got so many caps, and you don't have any straps <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So you'd be a fitted , so don't act like you fittin' to snap<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Bitch, I'll pee  on your head like a Phillies hat <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>No stoppin' me, you're on a window shopping spree<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Bitch, you probably go broke at the Dollar Tree<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You

choppin' 'em up like Dahmer<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The nut job with the nuts that are bigger than Jabba the Hutt<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'm in the cut, and I'm out for the blood<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's lookin' like it's that time of the month<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Carvin' 'em up with the bars while I sharpen 'em up, dog and a mutt<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'm gonna fuck your mom in the butt with a thermometer, fuckin' phenomenal, but<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Y'all'll get cut the fuck up like abdominals if you don't vámonos<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I keep droppin' like dominos, the formidable, abominable<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Stompin' a mudhole in my comp even if it's off the top of the dome<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Son 'em, get the Coppertone, I'm at the Stop and Go coppin' the Mop and Glo<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Got your stomach in knots like you swallowed

You ain't seen it! It's the size of a peanut <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Ecstasy—it's the worst drug in the world<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So don't get attached, or it'll attack every bone in your back<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Meet Zach: twenty-one years old<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Suddenly, he starts to convulse<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And his pulse goes into hyperdrive<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And his eyes roll back in his skull <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>His back starts to look like the McDonald's Arches<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal, barfin' <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So they're laughing at basically nothing<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Except maybe wasting their money<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So don't even feed that to squirrels, class, 'cause it's bad for you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>See, children, drugs are bad <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And if you don't believe me, ask your dad <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And if you don't believe him, ask your mom <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So kids, say no to drugs <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So you don't act like everyone else does <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And there's really nothin' else to say <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Drugs are just bad, mmkay?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And last but not least, one of the most humongous<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Problems among young people today is fungus<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It grows from cow manure; they pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And you put it right in your mouth and chew it<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Yum-yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And sometimes, you see things that aren't there <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Like fat women in G-strings with orange hair<|endoftext|><|startoftext|> It's yarn, Claire<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Whoops, did I say 'magic mushrooms?' I meant fungus<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Your tongue gets all swoll up like a cow's tongue<|endoftext|><|startoftext|> 'Cause it comes from a cow's dung <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>See, drugs are bad, it's a common fact<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But your mom and dad know that's all that I'm good at <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and you go and OD<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>They're gonna come for me, and I'ma have to grow a goatee<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 'cause I'm bad for you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>See, children, drugs are bad <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And if you don't believe me, ask your dad <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And if you don't believe him, ask your mom <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So kids, say no to drugs <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So you don't act like everyone else does <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And there's really nothin' else to say <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Drugs are just bad, mmkay?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Come on, children, clap along! <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Sing along, children! <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Come on, clap along<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So don't do drugs! <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So there'll be more for me <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>  <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>La la la Yo, check it out<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's fucked up<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause I don't see either one of us budging<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'm withholdin' my anger though I'd like to be the strangler<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's my right to insist that he acknowledge my existence<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But he just displays complete lack of respect<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>That's what he says to himself as he uses his magazines to trash me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>As he sits with both his feet up at his desk<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Smokes a bag of his weed and starts imaginin' things<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And he just can't see that he's manically depressed<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And in his jealousy and envy, it just whirls him in a frenzy<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>As he turns on MTV and sees my face<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>He don't exist in this world so he just twists and he twirls<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Spirals and spins 'til he hurls himself into a rage<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And it's destroyin' him slowly 'cause he does not even know me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Even though he sees me everywhere he goes<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So he just tortures himself, he has no fortune and wealth<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So he extorts someone else to get his dough<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And now he's actin' like a bully so he tries to push and pull me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And he has no choice but to scream and raise his voice up at me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You ain't no motherfuckin' bully<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no

must be fuckin' wit' you emotionally<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Now I'm not tryin' to make no more enemies, no more unfortunately<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>There's so many other motherfuckers there just are<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>They just keep houndin' at me now that I'm down with 50<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But his ass is such a puppet, Irv could shove his whole hand up it<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And just make him say what he wants him to say<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But Suge has Irv on a string and Irv's so nervous that he<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Says anything to this man to keep him at bay<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So now Ja thinks that he's so tough and Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And they go huff and puff and blow our label down<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But our building's made out of bricks so you ain't takin' out shit<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And, dawg, you just did a song with Bobby Brown<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So now you try to pull the race card and it backfires in your face hard<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause you know we don't play that black and white shit<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Plus this stylist you fucked when you was ecstasied up<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You ain't no motherfuckin' bully<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin'

throw my hands up to a bully<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You must be takin' too much E<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Now what bothers me the most about hip-hop is we're so

you rely on me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>As much as I rely on you to inspire me like you do<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You provide me the lighter fluid, the fuel to my fire<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You're my entire supply: gas, the match, and igniter<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The only way that I am able to stay so stable<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Is you're the

me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You're like the root to my evil, you let my devil come out me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And no matter how much, too much is never enough<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>]<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Go crazy on you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Crazy on

problem is neither one wants help<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's an addiction and it can't be fixed<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And it hurts 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>On every song, every lyric and every rhyme<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>All the hoopla, all of the whoopty-woo<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-do<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I won't be made a fool of if this is true love<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You wouldn't

there<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Right behind you, in your nightmares<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So I brought you the flowers and the candy<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>All the times that you threw it back at me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Told me you hate me, you gon' hate me more<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>When you find out, you can't escape me, whore<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The more you put me

want you more<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The more that you slap

down and write you a little poem<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But off of the dome would probably be a little more<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>More suitable for this type of song, whoa<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Sixteen bars just ain't enough to put some ink to<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So fuck it, I'ma start right here, I'll just be brief, I'm<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Bout to rattle off some of the reasons<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Of you on my arm, but what do I go and do?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I go and get another one, now I got two <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Now I'm sitting here with your name on my skin<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>If you only knew how much I hated you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>For every motherfucking thing you've ever put us through<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You don't know how sick you make me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You make me fucking sick

do<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Every time I think of you I puke<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I thought a song would probably be a little better<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Instead of a letter that you'd probably just shred up, yeah<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to, a stupid piece of<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Paper, I'd rather let you see how<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Much I fucking hate you in a freestyle<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You're a fucking cokehead slut, I hope you fucking die<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I hate your fucking guts, you fucking slut, I hope you die <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's just that when I think of you it makes me wanna yack <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But what else can I do? I haven't got a clue<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But every time I think of you now all I wanna do is pu-u-u-u-u-u-uke<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You don't know how sick you make me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You make me fucking sick to my stomach<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Every time I think of you I puke<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You may not think you do, but you do<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Every time I think of you I puke<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Eminem pukes into the toilet<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Eminem hocks and spits into the toilet<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Toilet flush<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Eminem burps<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Ah, damn!<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Fucking bitchI've always looked at battle rap as competition or war, and the main objective is to destroy, completely fuckin’ obliterate your opponent by saying anything and everything, whatever the fuck you can, to get a reaction from the crowd.

who you fuckin' wit'<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>When steppin' on hallowed groundAnd I’m willing to borrow your grass<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I specialize in eating

G.O.A.T. is<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It means the Greatest Of All Time<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I consider myself one of those<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So thank you very much, here it goes<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>This is the part I was worried about<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I'm in some dusty garage<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Inhalin' them carbon monoxide fumes<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And everyone's tellin' me what I should do<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And how I should come out and what to rap about<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I know I got a lot up<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>In my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I'm not sure how this is gonna come off<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>They're probably gonna think that I'm comin' off as cocky<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Like I just started givin' a fuck what you really think about me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>See, the thing about me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Is you don't really know a thing about me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Everyone's makin' a stink about me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Like there's some kind of an aura of that of the king around me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Surround me with nothin' but gangsters<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Killers and bangers and the most dangerous criminals<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I feel like I'm more comfortable around them<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Than I do my own motherfuckin' neighbors<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But see, my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when I leave<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But why does it seem like I'm not even put up in the same category as other MC's?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So when Weezy says that he's better than Jay Z<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Please be that just subliminally<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Means he thinks Jigga's the best<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And that he's the only one up in that league, see<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And it's easy just to consider me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>One of the greatest white rappers there is<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Knowin' goddamn well that I'm one of the best motherfuckin' rappers who ever lived, period<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'm a G.O.A.T. and I don't mean to gloat<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I know what I know and I know what you think<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And these magazines'll never put it in ink<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Because how would it look if they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It means the Greatest Of All Time<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I consider myself one of those<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So thank you very much, here it goes<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Maybe they figure that I'm on my way out the game<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So they gotta go try to find 'em a new Eminem or a new Shady<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>If they think it's gonna happen, man, I thought I was crazy<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Or maybe I could be takin' it wrong<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And they're tryna pay homage to me in a strange way<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>See, you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringin' up that Paul Wall's white<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>‘Cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone, see, he's just aight<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And Bubba Sparxxx, he just won't write<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Because he's so caught up in that snow white<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>That Timbaland can't even get him in the studio<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>He's so gone off that coke, right?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And it's so sad ‘cause he's dope, right?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>America's next great white hope, right?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny-ass White Rapper Show, right?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And which I'm still havin' mixed feelings about<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>They said it'd be real, I'm just spillin' it out<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>There's somethin' about a white boy talkin' black<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I love when the say that Tiger Woods shit<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And the best golfer's black?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack off of that<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But these are the people who never had heard of an Eminem until 8 Mile had came out<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I had already hit middle America<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Parents had all got to likin' me now<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>When suddenly I wasn't such a bad guy<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>All of the hatred for me must've died<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Thought I committed career suicide<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So I had to turn back into the bad guy<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So faggoty faggoty faggoty gays<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Anatomy God made Raggedy Ann and Andy<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Not Raggedy Andy and Andy and Andy<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And Angelina Jolie is just another ho<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And Brad is a sucka, because once I fuck her<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>She wants to go to Somalia to adopt another baby<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You know what I say? — No.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You better save some of them kids from Madonna<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>She needs all the publicity she can get<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You wanted Shady, well you got it, man, I ain't apologizin' for shit<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'm a G.O.A.T. and I don't mean to gloat<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I know what I know and I know what you think<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And these magazines'll never put it in ink<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Because how would it look<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>If they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It means the Greatest Of All Time<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I consider myself one of those<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So thank you very much, here it goes<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Man, I'm takin' my ball and goin' home<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Man, shit is too easy<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Nobody even wants to pass me the ball<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>‘Cause I'm a G.O.A.T.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So don't worry, I'm out the motherfuckin' game<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But y'all know that I'm a G.O.A.T.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And like I said, I'm one of the motherfuckin' best<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Before you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But before I go, I'd like to say fuck you very

home<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Is just a bed to me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>We don’t even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Meanwhile I’m in these streets with everybody, I’m trying to get it<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Look each other in the face and barely blink<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So if my

the weather<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Your guard is up and I know why<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Because the last time you saw me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Is still burned in the back of your mind<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You gave me roses, and I left them there to die<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So this is me swallowing my pride<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I'd go back to December all the time<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I go back to December all the time<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>These days, I haven't been sleeping<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Staying up, playing back myself leaving<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>When your birthday passed and I didn't call<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I think about summer, all the beautiful times<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I watched you laughing from the passenger side and<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Realized I loved you in the fall<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And then the cold came<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The dark days when fear crept into my mind<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So this is me swallowing my pride<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I'd go back to December all the time<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I go back to December all the time<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So good to me, so right<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And how you held me in your arms that September night<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The first time you ever saw me cry<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Maybe this is wishful thinking<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Probably mindless dreaming<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So if the chain is on your door, I understand<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But this is me swallowing my pride<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I'd go back to December<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Wishing I'd realized what I had

mind<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I go back to December all the time<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>All the timeFollow me home if you dare to<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I wouldn't know where to lead you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Should I take chances when no one took chances on me?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>With no beauty in my memory<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>All that I wanted was to be wanted<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Born into nothing<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>At least you have something, something to cling to<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And the memories were lost long ago<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But at least you have beautiful ghosts<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Perilous night, their voices calling<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>A flicker of light before the dawning<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Out here, the wild ones are taming the fear within me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Scared to call them my friends and be broken again<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Is this hope just a mystical dream?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>All that I wanted was to be wanted<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Too young to wander London streets, alone

get let into<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And the memories were lost long ago<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But at least you have beautiful ghosts<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And so maybe my home isn't what I had known<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>What I thought it would be<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I know that this life isn't safe, but it's wild and it's free<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>All that I wanted was to be wanted<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'll never wander London streets, alone and

let me into<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And the memories were lost long ago<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And the memories were lost long ago<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So I'll dance with these beautiful ghostsI was reminiscing just the other day<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Took off faster than a green light, go<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And that was the first day<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And darling, it was good<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Never looking down<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And right there where we stood<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Was holy ground<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>We had this big wide city all to ourselves<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>We blocked the noise with the sound of, I need you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And for the first time, I had something to lose<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I guess we fell apart in the usual way<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And the story's got dust on every page<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I see your face in every crowd<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause darling, it was good<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Never looking down<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And right there where we stood<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Was holy ground<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Tonight, I'm gonna dance<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>For all that we've been

static<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Stress and holiday shopping traffic<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Just like magic<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>In my heart is a Christmas tree farm<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Where the people would come<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>To dance under sparkling lights<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Bundled up in their mittens and coats<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And the cider would flow<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I just wanna be there

our shaking hands<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The crowds in stands went wild<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>We were the kings and the queens<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And they read off our names<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The night you danced like you knew our lives<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Would never be the same<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You held your head like a

now<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>We are the kings and the queens<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You traded your baseball cap for a crown<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>When they gave us our trophies<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And we held them up for our town<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And the cynics were outraged<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Screaming, This is absurd<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>In ripped up jeans got to rule the world<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Long live the walls we crashed

would've felt like<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>A million little shining stars had just aligned<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I would've been so happy<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Christmas lights glisten<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I've got my eye on the door<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Just waiting for you to walk in<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But the time is ticking<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>People ask me how I've been<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>As I comb back through my memory<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>How you said you'd be here<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You said you'd be here<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And it was like slow motion<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Standing there in my party dress<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>In red lipstick<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>With no one to impress<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And they're all laughing<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>As I'm looking around the room<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But there was one thing missing<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And that was the moment I knew<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And the hours pass by<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Now I just wanna be alone<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But your close friends always seem to know<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>When there's something really wrong<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So they follow me down the hall<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And there in the bathroom<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I try not to fall apart<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And the sinking feeling starts<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>As I say hopelessly<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>He said he'd be here<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And it was like slow motion<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Standing there in my party dress<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>In red lipstick<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>With no one to impress<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And they're all laughing<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And asking me about you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But there was one thing missing <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And that was the moment I knew<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>What do you say<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>When tears are streaming down your face<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>In front of everyone you know?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And what do you do<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>When the one who means the most to you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Is the one who didn't show?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You should've been here<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I would've been so happy<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And it was like slow

all standing around me, singing<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Happy birthday to you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But there was one thing missing<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And that was the moment I knew<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You called me later<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And said, I'm sorry I didn't make it<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I said, I'm sorry, too<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And that was the moment I knewFind myself at your door<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Just like all those times before<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I’m not sure how I got there<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>All roads they lead me here<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I imagine you are

better<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And right before your eyes<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'm breaking, no past<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>No reasons why<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Just you and

ones<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I used to know my place was a spot next to you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause lately, I don't

best to avoid me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Of how I was losing my mind when I saw you here<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But you held your pride like you should've held me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Oh, I'm scared to see the ending<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Why are we pretending this is nothing?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I've never heard silence quite this loud<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And we're not speaking<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I'm dying to know<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Is it killing you like it's killing

like a tragedy now<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>This is looking like a contest<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Of who can act like they care less<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I liked it better when you were on my side<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The battle's in your hands now<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I would lay my armor down<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>If you say you'd rather love than

yeah?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I don't know what to say since the twist of fate<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause we're going down<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The EndHere's something I've learned about people.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Let me say it again, louder for those in the back...<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>There will be no further explanation.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>There will be just reputation.You, with your words like knives<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And swords and weapons that you use against me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You have knocked me off my feet again<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Got me feeling like I'm nothing<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Calling me out when I'm wounded<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You, picking on the weaker man<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Well, you can take me down<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>With just one single blow<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But you don't know what you don't know<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Someday, I'll be living in a big old city<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And all you're ever gonna be is mean<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And all you're ever gonna be is mean<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Why you gotta be so mean?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You, with your switching sides<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And your wildfire lies and your humiliation<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You have pointed out my flaws again<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>As if I don't already see them<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I walk with my head down, trying to block you out<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause I'll never impress you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I just wanna feel okay again<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I bet you got pushed around<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Somebody made you cold<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But the cycle ends right now<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause you can't lead me down that road<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And you don't know what you don't know<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Someday, I'll be living in a big old city<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And all you're ever gonna be is mean<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And all you're ever gonna be is mean<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Why you gotta be so mean?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I can see you years from now in a bar<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Talking over a football game<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>With that same big loud opinion<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But nobody's listening<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But all you are is mean<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>All you are is mean<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But someday, I'll be living in a big old city<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And all you're ever gonna be

yourself in your war path<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Lost your balance on a tightrope<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Lost your mind trying to get it back<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Always a bigger bed to crawl into<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And everybody

of<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But at night, you live it all again<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>If only you had seen what you know now then<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>When everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to

strange that I don't know you at all<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Stumbled through the long goodbye<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>One last kiss, then catch your flight<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Right when I was just about to fall<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I told myself, don't get attached<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But in my mind, I play it back<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Spinning faster than the

splashed on the news front page<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And they tell you that you’re lucky, but you’re so confused<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And all the young things line up to take your place<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Another name goes up in lights<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You wonder if you’ll make it out alive<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But can you

of how you disappeared<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Chose the rose garden over Madison Square<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And it took some time, but I understand it now<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>‘Cause now my name

everyone in the room<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I'm only looking at you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I am not the kind of girl<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Who should be rudely barging in<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>On a white veil occasion<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But you are not the kind of boy<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Who should be marrying the wrong girl<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So don't say yes, run away now<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'll meet you when you're out<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Of the church at the back

dance<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>In a storm in my best dress, fearless<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Well, you stood there with me in the doorway<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You pull me in and I'm a little more brave<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really

air<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But right now, my time is theirs<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Seems like there's always someone who disapproves<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>They'll judge it like they know about me and you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The jury's out, but my choice is you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So don't you worry

hard<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The stakes are high, the water's rough<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But this love is ours<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And it's not theirs to speculate if it's

ours<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The stakes are high, the water's rough<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But this love is oursI'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I threw my phone across the room, at you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I was expecting some dramatic turn away<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But you stayed<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>This morning, I said we should talk about it<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>That's when you came in wearing a football helmet<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And said, Okay, let's talk<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I said<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Stay, stay, stay<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I think that it's best if we both stay<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Who took all of their problems out on me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I love you because you have given me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>No choice but to<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Stay, stay, stay<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You took the time to memorize me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>My fears, my hopes, and dreams<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I just like hanging out with you, all the time<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Stay, stay, stay, stay!<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Stay, stay, stay<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Stay, stay, stay, stay!<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Stay, stay, stay<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I think that it's best if we both stayI think... I think when it's all over it just comes back in flashes, you know? It's like a kaleidoscope of memories, it just all comes back. But he never does. I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen. It's not really anything he said or anything he did, it was the feeling that came along with it. And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again, but I don't know if I should. I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright, but I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you? Maybe he knew that when he saw me. I guess I just lost my balance. I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him, it was losing me.He is sensible and so incredible<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And all my single friends are jealous<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>He says everything I need to hear and it's like<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I couldn't ask for anything better<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>He opens up my door and I get into his car<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And he says you look beautiful tonight<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I feel perfectly fine<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You're so in love that you act insane<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And that's the way I loved you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Breaking down and coming undone<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's a roller coaster kind of rush<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I never knew I could feel that much<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And that's the way I loved you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>He respects my space<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And never makes me wait<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And he calls exactly when he says he will<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>He's close to my mother<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Talks business with my father<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>He's charming and endearing<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I'm comfortable<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You're so in love that you acted insane<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And that's the way I loved you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Breaking down and coming undone<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's a roller coaster kind of rush<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I never knew I could feel that much<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And that's the way I loved you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>He can't see the smile I'm faking<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And my heart's not breaking<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And you were wild and crazy<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Just so frustrating<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Intoxicating, complicated<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Got away by some mistake and now<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'm so in love that I acted insane<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And that's the way I loved you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Breaking down and coming undone<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's a roller coaster kind of rush<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I never knew I could feel that much<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And that's the way I loved you oh, oh<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And that's the way I loved you oh, oh<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Never knew I could feel that much<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And that's the way I loved youI said, Oh, my, what a marvelous tune<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It was the best night, never would forget how we moved<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The whole place was dressed to the nines<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And we were dancing, dancing<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Like we're made of starlight<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Like we're made of starlight<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Picked me up, late one night at the window<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The night we snuck into a yacht club party<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Pretending to be a duchess and a prince<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I said, Oh, my, what a marvelous tune<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It was the best night, never would forget how we moved<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The whole place was dressed to the nines<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And we were dancing, dancing<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Like we're made of starlight, starlight<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Like we're made of starlight, starlight<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>He said, Look at you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Worrying so much about things you can't change<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You'll spend your whole life singing the blues<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>If you keep thinking that way<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Don't you see the starlight, starlight?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Don't you dream impossible things?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Like, Oh, my, what a marvelous tune<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It was the best night, never would forget how we moved<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The whole

shots<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But don't make her drop you off around the block<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Remember that she's getting older too<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And don't lose the way

me,<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You never wanted to lock your door,<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Didn't want to face the you you don't know anymore<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>For fear she was much better before...<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But Darling, now you have to.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>If you're anything like me,<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>There's a justice system in your head<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>For names you'll never speak again,<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And you make your ruthless rulings.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Each new enemy turns to steel<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>They become the bars that confine you,<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>In your own little golden prison cell...<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But Darling, there is where you meet yourself.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>If you're anything like me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You've grown to hate your pride<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>To love your thighs<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And no amount of friends at 25<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Will fill the empty seats<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>At the lunch tables of your past<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The teams that picked you last...<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But Darling, you keep trying.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>If you're anything like me,<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You couldn't recognize the face of your love<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Until they stripped you of your shiny paint<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Threw your victory flag away<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway...<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Darling, later on you will thank your stars<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>for that frightful day.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>If you're anything like me,<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'm sorry.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But Darling, it's going to be okay.When she fell, she fell apart.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>as a child with sidewalk chalk<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>forming the words of a thousand voices<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Echoes she heard even in her sleep:<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Whatever you say, it is not right.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Whatever you do, it is not enough.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Your kindness is fake.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Your pain is manipulative.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>When she lay there on the ground,<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>She dreamed of time machines and revenge<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>and a love that was really something,<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Not just the idea of something.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>When she finally rose, she rose slowly<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Wary of phone calls and promises,<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Bathed in her brokenness<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>she never knew she needed<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Standing broad-shouldered next to her<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>was a love that was really something,<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>not just the idea of something.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>When she turned to go home,<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>She heard the echoes of new words<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>May your heart remain breakable<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But never by the same hand twice<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And even louder:<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>without your past,<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>you could never have arrived-<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>so wondrously and brutally,<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>...here.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And in the death of her reputation,<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>She felt truly alive.The first shots fired, everybody's gathered around<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You're looking at me like I tried to take you down<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>No, no, it's not what happened at all<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>There's no sound, I'm waiting on your next move<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>A showdown and I know where to hit you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But no, no, it's not how I wanted this to go down<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Now we're standing in the ring<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And you made your first swing<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And now we're fighting

had it all, but you couldn't keep a promise<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>No, no, I'm not the one who tore us apart<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Let me remind you for a minute why we're not fine<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Is she here? Is she's standing on the sidelines?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Oh, oh, can't you tell this is breaking my heart?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Now we're standing in the ring<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And you make the first swing<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And now I'm fighting dirty<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I ain't going down till they break it up<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I used to be on your side<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Now it's looking like we're going to battle<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And why you're taking shots at me like<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Somebody's gonna give you a medal?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I never wanna hurt you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I'm tired of taking all these blows<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And so I'd rather be on your side<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But if you wanna fight<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Let's go, oh, oh<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Let's go, oh, oh<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Now we're standing in the ring<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Breaking everything that we've been building up so long<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I don't wanna do this break it up<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But you're not who I thought you were<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And this is looking more like a war<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Looks like we're going to war<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I used to be on your side<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Now it's looking like we're going to battle<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I try to not break down crying<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>No one's gonna give you a medal<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I never wanna hurt you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I'm tired of taking all these blows<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And so I'd rather be on your side<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'd rather be on your side<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But if you wanna fight<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Baby let's go, oh, oh<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Looks like we're going to war<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Oh, oh<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The first shots fired<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Everybody's gathered around<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You're looking at me like I try to take you down<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>No, no, but if you wanna fight, baby, let's goOnce upon a time<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And we caught onto something<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Were you just kidding?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>We almost never speak<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I don't feel welcome anymore<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Baby, what happened?

and it rains in your bedroom<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Everything is wrong<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause I was there when you said forever and always<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Was I out of line?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Did I say something way too honest, made you run and

her<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I feel a responsibility to do what's upstanding and right<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's kinda like a code, yeah<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And you've been getting closer and closer<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And crossing so many lines<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And it would be a fine proposition<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>If I was a stupid

was changin' the minds of pretenders<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>While chasin' the clouds away<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Our hearts were ringin'<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>In the key that our souls were singin'<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>As we danced in the night, remember<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>How the stars stole the night away<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Ahh-ahh-ahh<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Hey, say that you remember<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Ai, ai, dancin' in September<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Ai, ai, never was a

love<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Remember how we knew love was here to stay<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Now, December found the love that we shared in September<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Only blue talk

daySo over the years, a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end. How long does it take, where do you write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and that's why I'm still so in love with song writing. So what I've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started, different ways. So I'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I sent this voice memo to Ryan Tedder because I'd always wanted to work with him, and finally we scheduled some studio time. So I always wanna be prepared. I wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said I can't stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else. So I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called I Know Places. So this was the voice memo I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing:<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Uh-uh-uh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i-i-i<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Na na na na waiting at the back door<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>They're around and the vultures come around<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And you know that they won't, they won't us<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Say what they want 'bout, say what they want 'bout us<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And you come and sing and listen<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I would not think about it but I'm not done<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Every know that a thing or two about it, thing or two about it, I<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And guns<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>They are the hunters we are the foxes<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And we run<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Baby, I know some places we won't be found<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Cause I, I know places we can hide<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I know places, I know places<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Uh-uh-uh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, oh-oh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, know places<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Or whatever. I don't know, but that's basically just like a dark, really dark lyric, like, bridge thing and it's about, like, everybody's, like, trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever, and it's like you just, whatever, you know, and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus. So I hope you like it, it wouldn't be a piano thing. It would be, like, . Like, very, like, beat. Now I'm just making weird sounds. Hope you like it!It's strange to think the songs we used to sing<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Yesterday I found out about you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Even now just looking at you: feels wrong<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It was a moment of weakness and you said, Yes<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You should've said, No<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You should've gone home<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You should've thought twice 'fore you let it

back of your mind<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I shouldn't be asking myself, Why?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You can see that I've been crying<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Baby, you know all the right things to say<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But do you honestly expect me to believe<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>We could ever be the same?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You say that the past is the past, you need one chance<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It was a moment of weakness and you said, Yes<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You should've said, No<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You should've gone

can't resist<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Before you go tell me this<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Was it worth it?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Was she worth this?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>No no, no,

looked at you like the stars that shined<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>In the sky, the pretty lights<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And our daddies used to joke about the two of us<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And rolled their eyes and said, Oh my my my<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Take me back to the house in the backyard tree<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You never did, you never did<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Take me back when our world was one block wide<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Just two kids, you and I<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Oh my my my my<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Well, I was sixteen when suddenly<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I wasn't that little girl you used to see<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But your eyes still shined like pretty lights<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And our daddies used to joke about the two of us<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>They never believed we'd really fall in love<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And said, Oh my my my<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Take me back to the creek beds we turned up<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Two A.M. riding in your truck, and all I need is you next to me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Take me back to the time we had our very first fight<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You stayed outside till the morning light<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Oh my my my my<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>A few years had gone and come around<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>We were sitting at our favorite spot in town<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And you looked at me, got down on one knee<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Our whole town came and our mamas cried<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You said I do and I did too<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Take me home where we met so many years before<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>We'll rock our babies on that very front porch<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>After all this time, you and I<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'll still look at you like the stars that shine<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>In the sky, oh my my mySo this next clip is, uh, from a session that I had with Max Martin and Johan Shellback and what we like to do is we like to run, um, a recording on our phones of everything we're doing when we're putting a song together, just in case one of us blurts out a cool melody and then we forget about it, we want to go back and then-and replay the tape so that we can remind ourselves what exactly we were saying. Um, so I brought in this idea called Blank Space, and this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time and they're shouting out these production ideas like, you know the Oh! at the beginning of the chorus, um, and that ended up in the song. So, this is the very beginning stages of the song on the album called Blank Space.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Nice to meet you, where you been?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I could show you incredible things<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Diamonds, seasides, all those things<|endoftext|><|startoftext|> this song that <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Like, oh my God, listen in<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Listen in, I do too<|endoftext|><|startoftext|> honest <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>We can all sing this and cry<|endoftext|><|startoftext|> thinking, all this time<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Oh my God, listening<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Just forget what you've heard about me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Don't believe what you hear about me, hear about me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause it's gonna be forever, or gonna go -<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Yeah! Hey, hey!<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Gonna go down in flames<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You can tell me when it's over -<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>This is like a, like an early 2000s Nelly track<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Long list of ex-love -<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I've got a blank space, baby<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Click I'll write your name<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I've got a blank space, baby<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Click I'll write your name<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>That's awesome! I love it<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Oh my god, everyone's gonna kill you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Yeah!I'm so glad you made time to see me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>How's life, tell me, how's your family<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I haven't seen them in a while<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You've been good, busier than ever<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>We small talk, work and the weather<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Your guard is up and I know why<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>'Cause the last time you saw me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Is still burned in the back of your

I'm sorry for that night<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I'd go back to December all the time<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I go back to December all the time<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>These days I haven't been sleeping<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Staying up playing back myself leaving<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>When your birthday passed and I didn't call<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I think about summer, all the beautiful times<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I watched you laughing from the passenger side and<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Realized I loved you in the fall<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So this is me swallowing my pride<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I'd go back to December all the time<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I go back to December all the time<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And how you held me in your arms that September night<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The first time you ever saw me cry<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Maybe this is wishful thinking<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Probably mindless dreaming<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So if the chain is on your door, I understand...<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And then he said, It's too late to apologize<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's too late...<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>He said, It's too late to apologize<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's too late...<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So this is me swallowing my pride <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I go back to December <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Wishing I'd realized what I

tractor rides<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Look now, the sky is gold<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I don't know why all the trees

away<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I know I had the best day with you today<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I'm thirteen now<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And don't know how my friends could be so mean<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But I know I had the best day with you today<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>God smiles on my little brother, inside and out<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>He's better than I am<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I had the best days with you<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>There is a video I found from back when I was three<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And Daddy's smart<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And you're the prettiest lady in

wrong<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I love you for giving me your eyes<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>For staying back and watching me shine<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>That I had the best day with you todayFriday night beneath the stars<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>In a field behind your yard<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>You and I are painting pictures in the sky<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>And sometimes we don't say a thing<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Just listen to the crickets

They are now about yours.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I was born in Reading, Pennsylvania on December 13, 1989.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>In the world we live in, much is said about when we are born and when we die. Our birthday is celebrated every year to commemorate the very instant we came into the world. And a funeral is held to mark the day we leave it. But lately I've been wondering... what can be said of all the moments in between our birth and our death? The moments when we are reborn...<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>The debate over whether people change is an interesting one for me to observe because it seems like all I ever do is change. All I ever do is learn from my mistakes so I don't make the same ones again. Then I make new ones. I know people can change because it happens to me little by little every day. Every day I wake up as someone slightly new. Isn't it wild and intriguing and beautiful to think that every day we are new?<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>For the last few years, I've woken up every day not wanting, but needing to write a new style of music. I needed to change the way I told my stories and the way they sounded. I listened to a lot of music from the decade in which I was born and I listened to my intuition that it was a good thing to follow this gut feeling. I was also writing a different storyline than I'd ever told you before.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I wrote about moving to the loudest and brightest city in the world, the city I had always been overwhelmed by... until now. I think you have to know who you are and what you want in order to take on New York and all its blaring truth. I wrote about the thrill I got when I finally learned that love, to some extent, is just a game of cat and mouse. I wrote about looking back on a lost love and understanding that nothing good comes without loss and hardship and constant struggle. There is no riding off into the sunset, like I used to imagine. We are never out of the woods, because we are always going to be fighting for something. I wrote about love that comes back to you just when you thought it was lost forever, and how some feelings never go out of style. I wrote about an important lesson I learned recently... that people can say whatever they want about me, but they can't make me lose my mind. I've learned how to shake things off.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I've told you my stories for years now. Some have been about coming of age. Some have been about coming undone. This is a story about coming into your own, and as a result... coming alive.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I hope you know that you've given me the courage to change. I hope you know that who you are is who you choose to be, and that whispers behind your back don't define you. You are the only person who gets to decide what you will be remembered for.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>From the girl who said she would never cut her hair or move to New York or find happiness in a world where she is not in love...<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Love, Taylor<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>1.

forever hold your peace,' the words said by preachers at the end of wedding ceremonies all over the world, right before the vows. It's a last chance for protest, a moment that makes everyone's heart race, and a moment I've always been strangely fascinated by. So many fantasize about bursting into a church, saying what they'd kept inside for years like in the movies. In real life, it rarely happens.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Real life is a funny thing, you know. In real life, saying the right thing at the right moment is beyond crucial. So crucial, in fact, the most of us start to hesitate, for fear of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. But lately what I've begun to fear more than that is letting the moment pass without saying anything.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I think most of us fear reaching the end of our life, and looking back regretting the moments we didn't speak up. When we didn't say 'I love you.' When we should've said 'I'm sorry.' When we didn't stand up for ourselves or someone who needed help.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>These songs are made up of words I didn’t say when the moment was right in front of me. These songs are open letters. Each is written with a specific person in mind, telling them what I meant to tell them in person. To the beautiful boy whose heart I broke in December. To my first love who I never thought would be my first heartbreak. To my band. To a mean man I used to be afraid of. To someone who made my world very dark for a while. To a girl who stole something of mine. To someone I forgive for what he said in front of the whole world.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Words can break someone into a million pieces, but they can also put them back together. I hope you use yours for good, because the only words you’ll regret more than the ones left unsaid are the ones you use to intentionally hurt someone.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>What you say might be too much for some people. Maybe it will come out all wrong and you’ll stutter and you’ll walk away embarrassed, wincing as you play it all back in your head. But I think the words you stop yourself from saying are the ones that will haunt you the longest.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>So say it to them. Or say it to yourself in the mirror. Say it in a letter you’ll never send or in a book millions might read someday. I think you deserve to look back on your life without a chorus of resounding voices saying ‘I could’ve, but it’s too late now.’<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>There is a time for silence. There is a time waiting your turn. But if you know how you feel, and you so clearly know what you need to say, you’ll know it.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I don't think you should wait. I think you should speak now.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Love, Taylor<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>PS: To all the boys who inspired this album, you should've known. ;)1.

This is  a song I did with Jack Antonoff, and Jack is one of my friends and so we're hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes I made this amazing track the other day. It's so cool, I love these guitar sounds. And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said Please, please let me have that. Let me play with it, like send it to me. And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called I Wish You Would, because Jack wrote back and said I love that. So this is another way of writing, it's writing to track:<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>Okay so this is an idea called I Wish You Would. It's kind of about this guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hate him, but she's still in love with him, very dramatic.

I want to thank all of the collaborators that you see on this stage. Mostly, I want to thank my co-executive producer Max Martin, who has deserved to be up here for 25 years. And as the first woman to win album of the year at the Grammy's twice, I want to say to all the young women out there, there are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame. But if you just focus on the work and you don't let those people sidetrack you, someday when you get where you're going, you will know it was you and the people who love you who put you there,  and that will be the greatest feeling in the world.

that for poetic effect, they were truly dusty with pictures drawn of first day of school outfits and inspirational quotes I used to retrace over and over to get me through doubtful moments. I'd practice my autograph and tape my guitar picks to the pages. In the entries, I daydreamed on paper and mused about who might ask who to the dance or how nervous I was saying the national anthem at the local baseball game. I frequently and drastically changed my opinions on love, friends, confidence and trust. I vented, described memories in detail, jotted down new song ideas and questioned why I would ever try to shoot for a career I had such a small chance of ever attaining.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>But what shocked me the most was how often I wrote down the things I loved. Writing a new song, riding in the car with my mom, the purple-pink skies of the soccer field  on the walk home, the one night in middle school when none of my friends were fighting, the dazzle of opal necklaces I couldn’t afford gleaming from a department store jewelry case. I wrote about tiny details in my life in these diaries from a bygone age with such... wonderment. Intrigue. Romance. I noticed things and decided they were romantic, and so they were.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>In life, we grow up and we encounter the nuanced complexities of trying to figure out who to be, how to act, or how to be happy. Like invisible smoke in the room, we wonder what kind of anxiety pushes you forward and what kind ruins your ability to find joy in your life. We constantly question our choices, our surroundings, and we beat ourselves up for our mistakes. All the while, we crave romance. We long for those rare, enchanting moments when things just fall into place. Above all else, we really, really want our lives to be filled with love.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>I've decided that in this life, I want to be defined by the things I love- not the things I hate, the things I'm afraid of, or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night. Those things may be struggles, but they're not my identity. I wish the same for you. May your struggles become inaudible background noise behind the loud, clergies voices of those who love and appreciate you. Turn those voices up in the mix in your head. May you take notice of the things in your life that are nice and make you feel safe and maybe even find wonderment in them. May you write down your feelings and reflect on them years later, only to learn all the trials and the tribulations you thought might kill you... didn't. I hope that someday you forget the pain ever existed. I hope that if there is a lover in your life, it's someone who deserves you. If that's the case, I hope you treat them with care.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>This album is a love letter to love itself- all the captivating, spellbinding, maddening devastating red, blue, gray, golden aspects of it <|endoftext|><|startoftext|>In honor of fever dreams, bad boys, confessions of love on a drunken night out, Christmas lights still hanging in January, guitar string scars on my

clearest, brightest daylight after the darkest night.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>We are what we love.<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>This is Lover.She walks to school<|endoftext|><|startoftext|>With her
